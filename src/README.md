## About kalitorify

**kalitorify** is a shell script for [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) which use [iptables](https://www.netfilter.org/projects/iptables/index.html) settings to create a **Transparent Proxy through the Tor Network**, the program also allows you to perform various checks like checking the Tor Exit Node (i.e. your public IP when you are under Tor proxy), or if Tor has been configured correctly checking service and network settings.

In simple terms, with kalitorify you can redirect all traffic of your Kali Linux operating system through the Tor Network.

**This program was created for the Kali Linux operating system (Kali Linux rolling 2020.x) , don't run on other Linux distributions if you're not sure what you're doing.**

### What is Tor?

if you don't know the Tor Network and the Tor Project (but even if you know them), I suggest you read the information from here:

Tor Anonimity Network on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_%28anonymity_network%29)

Tor Project [Website](https://www.torproject.org/)


### What is Transparent Proxy through Tor?

Transparent proxy is an intermediary system that sit between a user and a content provider. When a user makes a request to a web server, the transparent proxy intercepts the request to perform various actions including caching, redirection and authentication.

Transparent proxy via Tor means that every network application will make its TCP connections through Tor; no application will be able to reveal your IP address by connecting directly.

For more information about the Transparent Proxy through Tor please read the [Tor project wiki](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxy)

## Install

### Download kalitorify:

Download with `git`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/brainfucksec/kalitorify
```

Download [release](https://github.com/brainfucksec/kalitorify/releases) (package of the latest git version)

### Install dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y

sudo apt-get install -y tor curl
```

### Install kalitorify:
```bash
cd kalitorify/

sudo make install
```

### Reboot:

Services and programs that use kalitorify (such as iptables) work at the kernel level, at the end of the installation reboot the operating system to avoid conflicts.

## Security

### Please read this section carefully before starting kalitorify

**kalitorify is produced independently from the Tor anonimity software and carries no guarantee from the Tor Project about quality, suitability or anything else, please read these documents to know how to use the Tor network safely:**

[Tor General FAQ](https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en)

[Whonix Do Not recommendations](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/DoNot)

**kalitorify is a bash script to start a transparent proxy through Tor to be used for a safe navigation during communications, searches or other activities with Kali Linux, but does not guarantee 100% anonymity.**

About Transparent Torification, please read [Transparent Proxy Leaks](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxyLeaks) (mostly Microsoft Windows related) and/or consider an [Isolating Proxy](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/IsolatingProxy) as alternative.
See [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org/) for a complete, ready-made VM based solution (alternatively using multiple physical computers) built around the Isolating Proxy and Transparent Proxy [Anonymizing Middlebox design](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxy#AnonymizingMiddlebox).

###  Hostname and MAC Address security risks

Applications can still learn your computer's hostname, MAC address, serial number, timezone, etc. and those with root privileges can disable the firewall entirely. In other words, transparent torification with iptables protects against accidental connections and DNS leaks by misconfigured software, it is not sufficient to protect against malware or software with serious security vulnerabilities.

Source: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Tor

**Before run kalitorify you should change at least the hostname and the MAC address:**

[Setting the Hostname on Debian](https://debian-handbook.info/browse/stable/sect.hostname-name-service.html)

[Changing MAC Address on Linux](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Changing_Your_MAC_Address/Linux)

### Transparent Proxy with kalitorify and Tor Browser

**Don't start Tor Browser when transparent browsing (kalitorify) is active, this to** [avoid Tor over Tor Scenarios](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/DoNot#Allow_Tor_over_Tor_Scenarios).

---

### Checking for leaks

After starting kalitorify you can use [tcpdump](https://www.tcpdump.org/) to check if there are any internet activity other the Tor:

First, get your network interface:
```bash
ip -o addr
```

or

```bash
tcpdump -D
```

We'll assume its `eth0`.

Next you need to identify the Tor guard IP, you can use `ss`, `netstat` or `GETINFO entry-guards` through the tor controller to identify the guard IP.

Example with `ss`:
```bash
ss -ntp | grep "$(cat /var/run/tor/tor.pid)"
```

With the interface and guard IP at hand, we can now use `tcpdump` to check for possible non-tor leaks. Replace IP.TO.TOR.GUARD with the IP you got from the `ss` output.
```bash
tcpdump -n -f -p -i eth0 not arp and not host IP.TO.TOR.GUARD
```

You are not supposed to see any output other than the first two header lines. You can remove `and not host IP` to see how it would look like otherwise.

## Usage

**Before starting kalitorify:**

1 - Make sure you have read the section about [Security](#security).

2 - Disable your firewall if is active.

3 - Make a backup of the iptables rules if they are present, see: [iptables](https://wiki.debian.org/iptables)

Using the program is simple, the command-line options follow the [GNU Coding Standards](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Command_002dLine-Interfaces.html), you can use the short and long options, the commands syntax is:

`kalitorify --[option]`

or

`kalitorify -[option]`

For example, to display the help men√π, run command `kalitorify` with the `--help` or `-h` option:
```bash
kalitorify -h
```

To start the transparent proxy through Tor, use the option `--tor` or `-t`:
```bash
kalitorify -t
```

The available commands are listed below:

### Options:

**-h, --help**

    show this help message and exit

**-t, --tor**

    start transparent proxy through tor

**-c, --clearnet**

    reset iptables and return to clearnet navigation

**-s, --status**

    check status of program and services

**-i, --ipinfo**

    show public IP

**-r, --restart**

    restart tor service and change IP
